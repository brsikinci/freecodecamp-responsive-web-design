                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="bold">1809</span> - Born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">1825</span> - Enrolled in medical school at the University of Edinburgh.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">1831</span> - Accepted an offer to embark on a five-year voyage aboard HMS Beagle.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">1836</span> - Returned to England. A highly methodical scholar, constantly collecting and observing, 
                            he spent many years comparing and analysing specimens before finally declaring that evolution occurs by 
                            a process of natural selection.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">1859</span> - Published On the Origin of Species.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">1871</span> - Published The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">1882</span> - Died in Downe, Kent, England</li>
                    </ul>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“As man advances in civilization, and small tribes are united into larger communities, the simplest 
                            reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all members 
                            of the same nation, though personally unknown to him. This point being once reached, there is only an artificial 
                            barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races.”</p>
